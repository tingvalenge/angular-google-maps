Oriental music is a broad term that encompasses the musical traditions of various regions and cultures in Asia and the Middle East. Oriental music is diverse and rich in history, styles, instruments, and genres. Some of the major categories of oriental music are:
  
- Chinese music: one of the oldest and most highly developed musical systems in the world, with a history of over 3,000 years. Chinese music is based on a pentatonic scale and uses a variety of instruments such as the pipa (lute), the erhu (fiddle), the guzheng (zither), and the dizi (flute). Chinese music has many genres, such as folk songs, opera, instrumental ensembles, and modern pop and rock.[^2^]
- Middle Eastern music: a diverse and complex musical tradition that spans across many countries and cultures in the Middle East, such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Kurdish, Armenian, Jewish, and Coptic. Middle Eastern music is influenced by various musical systems, such as ancient Greek, Indian, Byzantine, and Islamic. Middle Eastern music is characterized by the use of microtonal scales (such as the maqam), complex rhythms, vocal ornamentation, and instruments such as the oud (lute), the ney (flute), the qanun (zither), and the darbuka (drum). Middle Eastern music has many genres, such as classical, folk, religious, pop, and fusion.[^3^]
- Indian music: a vast and ancient musical tradition that originated in the Indian subcontinent and spread to other regions such as Southeast Asia and Central Asia. Indian music is based on two main systems: Hindustani music (influenced by Persian and Islamic cultures) and Carnatic music (influenced by South Indian cultures). Indian music is built on a system of ragas (melodic modes) and talas (rhythmic cycles) that create a variety of moods and emotions. Indian music uses a range of instruments such as the sitar (lute), the sarod (lute), the bansuri (flute), the tabla (drums), and the harmonium (keyboard). Indian music has many genres, such as classical, folk, devotional, filmi, ghazal, qawwali, and bhangra.
