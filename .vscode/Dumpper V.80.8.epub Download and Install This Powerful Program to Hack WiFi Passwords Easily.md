To continue the article, I will explain how to use Dumpper V.80.8.epub to penetrate a wireless network and get the password. Here are the steps:
 
1. Download and install JumpStart, WinPcap, and Dumpper V.80.8.epub from the links provided in the previous section.
2. Open Dumpper V.80.8.epub. It will be in Spanish, so go to the far right tab and select 'English' in between the other two options.
3. In the 'Networks' tab, select the network adapter you wish to use. Hit the 'Scan' button now.
4. After it completes the scan, go over to the 'Wps' tab. In the area that says 'Connect using JumpStart', hit 'Browse' to select the location of where you installed JumpStart in the previous set-up steps. (By default, it installs in C:\Program Files (x86)\Jumpstart. Don't open it, just select the 'Jumpstart' folder and click 'OK')
5. In the area 'Show default pin', select 'All networks' instead of 'Only known networks'. Hit the 'Scan' button.
6. Select the network you wish to penetrate. Remember the 'Pin' corresponding to your network in the scan results, this will be needed for later.
7. Now, open JumpStart from the start menu or desktop shortcut. In the JumpStart interface, select 'Join a wireless network' and then 'Next'
8. Select 'Enter the PIN from my access point' and enter the PIN you got from Dumpper V.80.8.epub earlier. Then select the network you want to hack and then click 'Next'
9. Wait for a few minutes while JumpStart tries to connect to the network using the PIN. If successful, you will see a message saying 'You have successfully joined a wireless network'. Click 'Finish'
10. Now, go back to Dumpper V.80.8.epub and go to the 'Passwords' tab. You will see a list of networks with their passwords displayed in plain text. Find your target network and copy its password.
11. Congratulations! You have successfully hacked a wireless network using Dumpper V.80.8.epub and JumpStart.

Note: This method only works for networks that have WPS enabled and have a default PIN. Some routers may have WPS disabled or have a random PIN that cannot be guessed by Dumpper V.80.8.epub or JumpStart. Also, this method is illegal and unethical if done without permission from the network owner. Use it at your own risk and responsibility.
